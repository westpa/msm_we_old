Code for Markov state modeling of weighted ensemble trajectories.

* Authors: John Russo, Jeremy Copperman
* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://jdrusso.github.io/msm_we/ .


Features
--------

* Compute a history-augmented Markov state model from WESTPA weighted ensemble data
* Estimate steady-state distributions
* Estimate flux profiles
* Estimate committors


Known Issues
------------

* Sometimes, on Python3.7 (and maybe below) the subprocess calls will fail. This may manifest as a silent failure,
followed by hanging (which is very fun to debug!) To fix this, upgrade to Python 3.8+.

Code development TODOs
-----
*  Provide option for user to override :code:`dimReduce()` in case they want to do something other than PCA/VAMP
*  Add TICA option to :code:`dimReduce()`
